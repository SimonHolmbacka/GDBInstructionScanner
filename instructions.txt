 
build the file with the -g flag
$ gcc -g test.c -o myprog

start GDB and load the binary file
$gdb myprog

set breakpoint where you want your instruction counts to start
it can be set as per function name or as line number
$(gdb)b main

run to this line
$(gdb)r

load the python script which counts instructions
$(gdb)source ci.py

optionally set the breakpoint where you want the instruction count to end
$(gdb)b 1023

run the python script (this can take a long long time...)
$(gdb)ci

After it is completed, the complete instructions are in the file instructionseq.txt
